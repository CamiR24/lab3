            You step through the concealed entrance behind the stone wall and into the Slytherin common room. 
            The atmosphere is dark and mysterious.

            The room has elegant furniture, its dark green and silver decoration transmiting an aura of power and ambition. 
            Large windows provide a great view of the depths of the Black Lake, where the shadow of the giant squid drift past.
            A grand fireplace crackles with emerald-green flames, casting long shadows across the plush leather armchairs.
