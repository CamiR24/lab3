            <strong>Professor Lupin:</strong>
            Welcome, everyone, to Defense Against the Dark Arts. I'm Professor Lupin, and I promise you, 
            this class will be different from the others. We're not just going to study theory, we're 
            going to practice real-life defense tactics. This subject is vital, and it can be both exciting 
            and dangerous, but with the right preparation, you'll be able to face any threat that comes your way.
             No need to be frightened, just be prepared to face some of the darker aspects of magic. 
             I trust you'll all rise to the challenge!
