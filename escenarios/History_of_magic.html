            <strong>Professor Binns:</strong>
            Ah, yes, students... Welcome to History of Magic. I am Professor Binns, and I shall be your guide through
            the dull and uneventful world of magical history. Do pay attention, though it is unlikely that any of you 
            will find this subject particularly... thrilling. We shall cover the key events, such as the Founding of 
            Hogwarts and the rise of dark wizards, but do not expect excitement, as my lessons are not known for their... 
            er... liveliness.
            Now, let us move on, shall we? We shall begin with the events listed in your syllabus, which you are 
            required to memorize for your upcoming exams. Good luck, I suppose.
