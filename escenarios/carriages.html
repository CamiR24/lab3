            You arrive to the castle once again and enter the magnificent Great Hall, its enchanted ceiling reflecting the night sky above. 
            Professor Dumbledore stands tall, waiting to address all the kids, after the sorting.

            <strong>Dumbledore:</strong>
            Welcome, welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words… and here they are: 
            Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Now that we have that out of the way, let me extend my warmest welcome to both returning 
            students and our new first years. Hogwarts is a place of learning, but also of friendship, bravery, and, of course, a little bit of magic. 
            This year, as always, I encourage you to explore, to question, and to grow. But do remember—our corridors hold many secrets, 
            and some doors are best left unopened! 
            And now, let the feast begin!

            After the feast you are finally allowed to go to your rooms and get some rest.
            As it is the first night you are not allowed to explore the castle. You need to 
            rest. And always remember that you can't visit the othe houses common rooms.
