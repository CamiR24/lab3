            The room is a circular chamber at the top of a high tower, filled with tall windows offering 
            an incredible view of the mountains and the lake. Bookshelves stretch to the ceiling, filled with 
            ancient tomes and enchanted scrolls. A grand midnight-blue carpet covers the floor, 
            and a delicate chandelier in the shape of a constellation glows, illuminating students deep in study.
