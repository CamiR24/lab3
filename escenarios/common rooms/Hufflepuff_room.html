            You tap the correct rhythm on the wooden barrels and step into the warm and inviting Hufflepuff 
            common room, hidden beneath the castle, near the kitchen.

            The room is a cozy, and filled with earthy tones and lots of plants. The scent of fresh herbs 
            drifts from the kitchen nearby. Overstuffed armchairs, golden tapestries, and wooden tables make 
            it a perfect place for studying, sharing stories, or simply relaxing with friends. 
            The warmth of the fireplace makes you feel right at home.
