        <h2>It Was All a Dream...</h2>
        <p>
            You had a wonderful journey at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, 
            filled with magical classes, incredible creatures, and unforgettable adventures. 
            But the spells, the potions, the enchanted halls—none of it was real. It’s time 
            to wake up and return to the real world. Your place is not at Hogwarts... it’s at 
            Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (UVG), where your real studies await. The magic 
            you experienced here was just a glimpse of your imagination, but your future lies 
            in the classrooms and challenges that await. So, take a deep breath, gather your things, 
            and prepare to head back to UVG. Your real adventure begins now."
