            <strong>Professor Sprout:</strong>
            Welcome to Herbology, dear students! I'm Professor Sprout, and I’m thrilled to have you in my class. 
            In Herbology, you will learn about magical plants and their fascinating properties. These plants can 
            be incredibly dangerous, but with the right knowledge, you'll be able to handle them safely. Remember, 
            plants are not just for decoration; they can be powerful allies, or formidable foes, depending on how well 
            you understand them. Get ready for some hands-on learning— just be cautious, some of these plants bite!
