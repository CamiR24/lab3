            <strong>Professor Snape:</strong>
            Ah, yes. Welcome to Potions, where we will delve into the intricate art of brewing, 
            and where some of you— if you're lucky— might actually succeed in brewing something 
            that resembles a potion rather than a cauldron full of muck. As for those who can't 
            even manage that, well, we can always use the extra hands for cleaning the laboratory. 
            It’s a simple fact that some students simply lack the... *talent* needed to master the craft. 
            For those of you who are *not hopeless*, we will study some of the most difficult and 
            delicate potions. You will need precision, patience, and most importantly, the ability to follow 
            instructions— something I am sure many of you struggle with. Let’s see how well you fare."

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Draught of Peace</strong> - A calming potion used to soothe anxiety and stress. Be careful not to over-brew, or it will have the opposite effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Veritaserum</strong> - A powerful truth serum. If you think you can handle it, we might have a discussion about your... *hidden secrets*.</li>
                <li><strong>Amortentia</strong> - The most powerful love potion known to wizardkind. Remember, while it is highly effective, it can also have rather... unsettling effects on the mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Polyjuice Potion</strong> - A complicated potion that allows the drinker to assume the form of someone else. Of course, it’s incredibly difficult, and many of you will likely make a mistake... as usual.</li>
                <li><strong>Felix Felicis</strong> - A potion known as "Liquid Luck." A very tricky brew that must be used sparingly, as it can make you overconfident... not that any of you would need help with that.</li>
